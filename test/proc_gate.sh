# proc_gate.sh BUILDDIR: the process front end (cmc --model-file) gives
# the right verdict on every fixture in test/proc/, and refuses every
# model file or setting it does not implement instead of ignoring it.
#
# Each fixture is an ordinary program written as it ships (blocking TCP,
# no libcmc header) plus a model file.  The verdicts pinned here are the
# ones the prototype got wrong before M7 (idle, fifo, chain, depth bound,
# bigmsg) and the bugs the front end exists to catch (repl, elect, lease,
# durlog, paxos).  The loader rows are holes the prototype had: a
# mistyped or unimplemented key was ignored (a false pass), and a
# missing preload let the target read the real clock.
#
# Linux x86-64 only (seccomp user notification); elsewhere it says so
# and exits 0.
